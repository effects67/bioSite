<p>  My name is Alicia Sanchez. I was born in Dallas, Texas in 1994 and have loved living here ever since. I live with my family and am the oldest child, 
with two sisters and one brother. I attend the University of North Texas and am currently majoring in accounting. 
When I'm not helping take care of my family or going to school, I work as a baby-sitter at a local church-run day care.

<h2> Hobbies </h2>

<p> When I'm not busy with school and work, I love to play video games, read, listen to music, and watching movies.
I am constantly roaming around Dallas playing Pokemon Go, but when I'm home, I prefer to play League of Legends. 
My favorite music genre is bachata and country, both of which remind me
of home. My favorite movie would have to be "The Little Mermaid". I watched it non-stop as a child and can still quote it line-for-line.</p>
